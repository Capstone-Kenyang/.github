# Kenyang

Hi, everyone! We are a team of 7 members from Bangkit Academy 2024 Batch 1 who will develop a product capstone project called “Kenyang”. Kenyang is a project that aims to be the answer to reduce food waste from restaurants and make it easier for users to buy excess food at a discounted price, as well as share food with communities in need. With the theme Sustainable Futures, Kenyang can be a hope to combat food waste, reduce hunger, and create a more sustainable and inclusive food system.
